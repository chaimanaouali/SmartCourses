## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" error
- Check that you copied the full token (starts with `hf_`)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Restart the Django server after updating `.env`

### "Model is loading" error
- First request may take 20-30 seconds
- Hugging Face models need to "wake up"
- Try again after 30 seconds

### Image quality not good enough
- Add more details to your description
- Try different wording
- Use style keywords like "high quality", "detailed", "professional"

### Rate limits
- Free tier: ~1000 requests/month
- If you hit limits, wait 24 hours or create another account
